# ComposeFlashlight
Flashlight app with minimalistic design and several work modes.

## Android development

Compose flashlight is an app that attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:

 * Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
 * Uses [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for building native UI
 * Uses [Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) for navigation between screens
 * Uses [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/coroutines-guide.html) throughout
 * Uses [Data Store](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) as data storage solution
 * Uses [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection

## Development setup

First off, you require the latest Android Studio 4.2 Canary to be able to build the app. This is because the project is written in [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (more on that below).
