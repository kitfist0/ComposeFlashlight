# Privacy Policy

## General

Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how information obtained from users is collected, used and
disclosed. By using Flashlight, you agree that your personal information will be handled as
described in this Policy.

## Collected data

The app has no internet access, so it is not sending anything outside the device whatsoever.
Flashlight does not collect any personal identifiable information. The CAMERA permission is used up
to Android 6 for accessing the camera, which on some devices is required for toggling the flashlight
itself.

## Changes to the Policy

If the Policy changes, the modification date below will be updated. The Policy may change from time
to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. If you have any questions about the Policy,
please contact me via mdeveloperspost@gmail.com
